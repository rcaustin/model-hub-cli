BusFactorMetric.py
==================

Estimates the "bus factor" risk — the risk that project knowledge and
maintenance responsibility is concentrated in too few contributors.

Signal
------
- Positive signal when a project has multiple active contributors sharing
  the workload.
- Negative signal when commits and contributions are dominated by one or
  very few individuals.

Inputs (from context)
---------------------
- GitHub repository metadata including:
    - contributors list with contribution counts
    - repository metadata such as stars, forks, and recent activity
- HuggingFace metadata for author or organization information

Heuristics (illustrative)
-------------------------
- Number of active contributors (top 10 considered)
- Distribution of contributions among top contributors (min/max ratio)
- Known large organizations automatically scored as low risk

Scoring (0–1)
-------------
- 1.0 if at least 3 contributors with relatively balanced contributions
  (dominance ratio <= 0.5)
- 0.5 if 2-3 contributors or dominance ratio <= 0.75
- 0.0 if 1 or fewer contributors or dominance ratio > 0.9

Limitations
-----------
- Contributor data may exclude private or minor contributors
- Stars and forks are weak proxies for bus factor risk
- Recency and normalization by project size are not considered but can
  improve accuracy

Note
----
This metric corresponds to the "Bus Factor" metric in the specification,
providing an estimate of risk associated with knowledge centralization
within the maintainers of a project.
